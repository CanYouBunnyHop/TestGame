This project is multiplayer top-down shooter.

The project is put on-hold, I used the free PeerJS Server as a signalling server to establish p2p connection, although there are nothing being sent between the peers.
I used the PixiJs library to handle the rendering
There is also a working implementation of collision detection using SAT Collidion detection algorithm, optimised using Quadtree

You can test the Quadtree here https://canyoubunnyhop.github.io/TestGame/room/collisionTest.html
